# Clipper Development Progress

## Project Overview
Podcast clip generation SaaS tool - Transform podcasts into viral clips with AI transcription and social sharing.

## Current Status: Step 3 of 5 ‚úÖ (COMPLETE)

### ‚úÖ Completed (Steps 1-3)
- **Project Setup**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Supabase
- **Authentication**: Working login/signup with Supabase Auth + RLS policies + Demo Mode
- **Database**: Schema created (users, podcasts, episodes, clips tables)
- **Podcast Search & Subscription**: Complete UI + API routes + RSS parsing + Demo Mode
- **Deployment**: Working demo at localhost with full UI functionality

### üéØ Step 3 Implementation Details (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ API routes: `/api/podcasts/*` (search, subscribe, unsubscribe)
- ‚úÖ Podcast search interface with tabbed navigation
- ‚úÖ RSS parsing and episode counting
- ‚úÖ Subscription management (add/remove podcasts)
- ‚úÖ Demo mode with mock data (while waiting for Podcast Index API approval)
- ‚úÖ Dual route structure: `/podcasts` (demo) + `/dashboard/podcasts` (authenticated)
- ‚úÖ Fixed all authentication context errors and route conflicts

### ‚è∏Ô∏è WAITING FOR: Podcast Index API Read/Write Credentials
- User has requested API access but waiting for approval
- Demo mode fully functional with mock podcast data
- Ready to swap in real API once credentials arrive

### üîÑ Current Phase: Ready for Step 4 - Episode Management & Transcription
**Next Cursor Prompt #4:**
```
Implement episode listing, audio playback, OpenAI Whisper transcription, and episode management features
```

### üìã Remaining Steps (4-5)
4. Episode Management & Transcription (OpenAI Whisper API)
5. Clip Generation & Video Export (FFmpeg + Canvas)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)  
- **Podcast Data**: Podcast Index API + RSS parsing
- **AI**: OpenAI Whisper (transcription), GPT-4 (clip recommendations)  
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Budget**: ~$40-60/month target

## Key Architecture Decisions
- Using Podcast Index API (free) + RSS parsing instead of paid podcast APIs
- Batch transcription to minimize costs
- Static waveform animations (not real-time)
- Freemium model with premium AI features

## Directory Structure (FIXED!)
- Clean single directory: `/Users/mattvaccaro/clipper/`
- No more nested clipper/clipper/ confusion

## Development Workflow
- Claude (planning/architecture) + Cursor (implementation)
- Deploy to Vercel for testing (localhost issues resolved)
