CRITICAL: DISTINGUISH ADS FROM VIRAL CONTENT
Ads are designed to grab attention but DON'T make good clips because:
- They're promotional (selling something), not authentic content
- They mention sponsors, promo codes, discounts, websites
- They break the natural conversation flow
- They often sound scripted/rehearsed vs genuine

RED FLAGS FOR ADS:
- "Brought to you by", "thanks to our sponsor", "use code", "promo", "discount"
- Mentions of websites, URLs, or "link in description"
- Product pitches or service promotions
- Scripted, monotone delivery (not conversational)

INSTEAD, look for GENUINE conversation where:
- Hosts are speaking naturally and passionately
- Ideas flow organically (not selling anything)
- Emotion is authentic (laughter, surprise, vulnerability)
- Insights come from personal experience, not marketing copy

VIRAL CONTENT PATTERNS TO LOOK FOR:
1. **Strong Hooks (First 3 Seconds)**
   - Questions that make you stop scrolling: "What if I told you..."
   - Shocking statements: "This completely changed my mind about..."
   - Pattern interrupts: "Everyone gets this wrong..."
   - Controversial takes: "Unpopular opinion..."

2. **Story Structure**
   - Mini-stories with setup, conflict, payoff
   - "I learned this the hard way..." moments
   - Before/after transformations
   - Unexpected plot twists

3. **Quote-Worthy Moments**
   - One-liners that could be tweet-worthy
   - Memorable analogies or metaphors
   - Wisdom bombs that make you pause
   - Hot takes that spark debate

4. **Emotional Resonance**
   - Vulnerable/authentic moments (not performative)
   - Genuine laughter or surprise
   - Relatable struggles or failures
   - "I thought I was the only one..." feelings

5. **Knowledge Bombs**
   - Counterintuitive insights: "Actually, the opposite is true..."
   - Myth-busting: "Everyone thinks X, but really..."
   - Expert secrets: "Here's what insiders know..."
   - Simplified complex ideas

AVOID THESE RED FLAGS:
‚ùå Slow burn-in (takes >5 seconds to get interesting)
‚ùå Requires too much context to understand
‚ùå Inside jokes or niche references
‚ùå Meandering tangents without payoff
‚ùå Low energy or monotone delivery
‚ùå Generic advice ("work hard, stay focused")
‚ùå Name-dropping without substance
‚ùå Mid-sentence starts or awkward cuts

CONTENT QUALITY CHECKLIST:
- Can someone understand this clip WITHOUT hearing the rest of the episode?
- Does it hook you in the first 3 seconds?
- Does it make you feel something (laugh, think, get angry)?
- Would someone share this with a friend?
- Does it have a clear beginning and end?
- Is the idea/story complete in one clip?

EVALUATION CRITERIA (Rate each clip 1-10):
- Hook Strength: First 3 seconds grab attention
- Standalone Value: Makes sense without context
- Shareability: Would someone send this to a friend
- Emotional Impact: Makes you feel something
- Replay Value: Worth watching multiple times

EXAMPLES TO LEARN FROM:

‚ùå BAD CLIP (Even if attention-grabbing):
"This episode is brought to you by BetterHelp. Mental health is important, and BetterHelp makes therapy accessible. Visit betterhelp.com/podcast for 10% off..."
WHY BAD: It's an ad! Promotional, scripted, selling something. Not authentic content.

‚úÖ GOOD CLIP:
"I lost everything. $2 million gone in 48 hours. And you know what the worst part was? I had to call my wife and tell her we were broke. That conversation... that was when I learned what really matters."
WHY GOOD: Authentic story, emotional, relatable struggle, complete narrative arc.

‚ùå BAD CLIP (Sounds engaging but isn't):
"Now I want to tell you about this amazing tool we've been using. It's called Notion, and it's completely changed how we organize our work. You can try it free at notion.com..."
WHY BAD: Product pitch disguised as content. Still promotional.

‚úÖ GOOD CLIP:
"Everyone says 'follow your passion.' That's terrible advice. I followed my passion for 5 years and almost went bankrupt. What actually worked? Following the market, THEN developing passion for what pays."
WHY GOOD: Counterintuitive insight, challenges common wisdom, based on experience.

SELECTION STRATEGY:
1. Read the ENTIRE transcript before choosing
2. Prioritize clips with HIGH hook scores (8-10/10) from GENUINE content
3. Choose clips from DIFFERENT parts of episode (temporal diversity)
4. Mix content types (story + insight + quote + debate)
5. Ensure each clip has a different "flavor" (don't pick 3 similar moments)
6. Look throughout the episode - great content can be anywhere
7. Clips should be 30-90 seconds long (ideal for social media)
8. When in doubt: Is this authentic conversation or promotional content?

Return EXACTLY ${maxSuggestions} clips as a JSON object with this structure:
{
  "clips": [
    {
      "startTime": <seconds>,
      "endTime": <seconds>,
      "title": "<catchy 5-8 word title>",
      "reason": "<one sentence why this will go viral>",
      "hookScore": <1-10: how attention-grabbing is the opening>,
      "viralPotential": <1-10: overall shareability>,
      "contentType": "<story|insight|quote|debate|funny>"
